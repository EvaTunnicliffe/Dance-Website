      <h3>Lynlee Anne Ward</h3>
      <hr>
         <p class="subheading2"><i>Director</i></p>
      <p class="teachertext">When Lynley Anne started school, she wanted nothing more than to start dance lessons, but her
          mother said no she  phoned up to enrol herself at a local school, and made her way with the $2.00 fee to class
          in the lounge of the teacher’s house. Over the years her love for dance started to grow she invited by a English
          examiner to attend dance school in Somerset. The Building Society set up a fundraising thermometer to help
          fund her way to England. After doing her exams Lynley Anne completed her training at Pineapple Studios in
          Covent Garden. She did teacher training in Sydney before coming back to start her own school in 1989 with
          twenty-odd students. Lynley Anne continues to teach jazz and ballet to all ages. She is also sometimes
          an external examiner for AJDA.

      <h3>Brooke Candy</h3>
      <hr>
         <p class="subheading2"><i>Jazz</i></p>
      <p class="teachertext">Brooke has had a passion for dance and performance from a young age. She grew up
          dancing at LA Dance starting with ballet at four years old, with Jazz, Contemporary and Hip Hop
          following close behind. At only 19 years old, she has accomplished a lot with her dancing career,
          from not only being a teacher at the dance school she grew up in, but now attending the full time
          dance school Te Auaha. Brooke has always had dance in her life, and she is so glad and happy that
          she is able to provide others with the same joy that dancing provides her.

      <h3>Kara Gibson</h3>
      <hr>
       <p class="subheading2"><i>Jazz, ballet, Ready Set dance, Social Media</i></p>
      <p class="teachertext">Kara is a 17 year old that has been dancing with LA Dance since she was four years old.
          Like Susannah, she has taken jazz, ballet, contemporary and acro classes all throughout her dance years, but
          currently she only does ballet and jazz. Kara teaches jazz and ballet, along with the Ready Set dance students
          as well. Along with that, Kara is also the person who runs all of our social media, which is another hard job
          on top of her teaching job. This shows her determination, and love for all things dance. She hopes to see as
          many new faces at the studio as possible!
